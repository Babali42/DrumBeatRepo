## ðŸŒ± How to Contribute

Contributions are **welcome**! Whether you're into music, coding, or both, your input can help this project grow.

### Main Idea of Contributing

The app has great potential, especially with diversity in music genres. I'm working on making it easier to add beats and samples, but for now, feel free to modify the code to add your own beats, samples, or even new features!

### What Can You Contribute?

Start by checking out the **good first issues** in the repository.

If you don't see any open issues, you can also explore the GitHub projectâ€™s Kanban boards to get an idea of whatâ€™s being worked on and where you can contribute.

### How to Contribute?

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b your-feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -am 'Add new feature or fix'`).
4. Push to your branch (`git push origin your-feature-branch`).
5. Open a Pull Request (PR) â€” Iâ€™ll review it and provide feedback!

Feel free to reach out with any questions or ideas. Every contribution helps, no matter how small!
